CS118: Computer Network Fundamentals
=====

This is a repository for the projects assigned in Professor Lu's Fall 2014 class.

### Project 1: Concurrent Web Sockets using BSD Sockets
-------------------------------------------------------
We developed a web server in C/C++ that parsed HTTP request messages from the browser, creates an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, and sends the response directly back to the client. The web server supports both text and binary files. 

### Project 2: Window-based RDT over UDP
--------------------------------------------------------
We implemented Go-Back-N protocol communicating over UDP for receiver and sender. This involved creating our own packet data structure to hold relevant information and the data.
