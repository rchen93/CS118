1. In this project, you will implement a simple window-based protocol built on top of either Selective Repeat
protocol or Go-Back-N protocol described in the textbook. It's up to you which protocol you will work
on. Stop-wait and Stop-forward protocols are NOT allowed in this project. You must write one program
implementing the sender side, and another program implementing the receiver side. Only C and/or C++ are
allowed in this project. No 3rd-party libraries are allowed.
2. The two programs should communicate the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which does not guarantee data
delivery.
3. The receiver program will also act as a client application, requesting a file from the sender side.
4. The receiver program will take the hostname and port number of the sender, and the name of a file it wants
to retrieve from the sender as a command line arguments. For example:
to run the sender program: shell > sender < portnumber >
to run the receiver program: shell > receiver < sender hostname >< sender portnumber >< filename >
5. The receiver will first send a message to the sender which includes the name of the file requested. If the file
exists, the sender will divide the entire file into multiple packets (the maximum packet size is 1K bytes), and
then add some header information to each packet before sending them to the receiver. It is up to you what
information you want to include in the header (e.g. Source, Destination port etc...), but you will at least need
a sequence number field. You are free to define what kind of messages you will require, and the format of the
messages. You can create a large file being requested on your own, but make sure the file is transmitted in
multiple packets.
